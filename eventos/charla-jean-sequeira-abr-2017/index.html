<h4><strong>Charla: </strong>Research and Applications in the fields of Image Analysis, Geometrical Modeling and Visualization</h4>

<p>
<strong>Expositor: </strong> 
Jean Sequeira, PhD, Aix Marselle Université (AMU, France)
</p>

<p> 
<strong>Resumen:</strong>  
This presentation will give an overview of the applications related to “image” in Computer Science. It will 
also introduce the research activity in this field. Image Analysis is related to the extraction of information 
from images in order to enable computers to “understand” the scene represented in these images. Geometrical 
Modeling provides a mathematical support to the representation of objects to be detected by Image Analysis 
or to be visualized. Visualization consists in providing images that communicate a relevant information 
to an end user. Applications deal with Remote Sensing (Satellite Imaging, but also UAV - Unmanned Aerial 
Vehicles - imaging), Video Watching, Computer Vision (in particular for Robotics), Forensics (Scientific Police), 
Medical Imaging, Recognition of Activities and several other fields. It will be illustrated by ongoing or 
recently achieved research projects.

<strong>Biografía:</strong>  
Prof. Jean Sequeira was born in Marseilles (France) in 1953. He graduated from « Ecole Polytechnique » in 1977 
and from « Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Télécommunications » in 1979. Then, he taught Computer Science from 
1979 to 1981 in an engineering school of Ivory Coast (at the ENSTP, Yamoussoukro). From 1981 to 1991, he had 
been the manager of projects on 3D medical imaging at the IBM Paris Scientific Center and he participated to 
the design of the IBM 5080 graphics workstation (1983 – Kingston, New York State). During this period, he 
obtained a “Docteur Ingénieur” degree (PhD) in 1982 and then a “Doctorat d’Etat” degree (Habitation to supervise 
PhD students) in 1987. He has been a “Full Professor” at the University of Marseilles since 1991 (since 2010, he 
is an “Exceptional Class Professor”). In 1994, he created a research group on “Image Analysis and Computer 
Graphics” and then, in 2001, he participated to the creation of the LSIS Laboratory (Laboratoire des Sciences 
de l’Information et des Systèmes). He published more than 130 papers, about 40 of them in Journals. He organized 
International Conferences, he is in the Scientific Committee of several Journals and International Conferences 
and he is a IEEE “Senior Member”. He was the Scientific Director of 27 PhD research work.
