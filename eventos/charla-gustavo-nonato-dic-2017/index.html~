<h4><strong>Charla: </strong>Graph Laplacian and Multidimensional Data Visualization: a worthwhile partnership.</h4>

<strong>Expositor: </strong> 
Luis Gustavo Nonato, PhD - New York University (NYU, USA) / University of Sao Paulo (USP, Brazil)
</p>

<p> 
<strong>Resumen:</strong>  
Graph Laplacian has long been a fundamental tool in fields such as computer vision, geometry processing, and 
machine learning. In the last decade, Graph Laplacian has also emerged in the context of visual data analysis, 
leveraging the development of important techniques such as steerable dimensionality reduction, semantic layout 
construction, and visualization of time varying data. In this talk I will provide an intuitive introduction to 
Graph Laplacian, showing its versatility in a variety of information visualization applications, including 
interactive music play list construction, web query visualization, and visual detection of events from urban data.

<strong>Biografía:</strong>  
Luis Gustavo Nonato received the PhD degree in Applied Mathematics from the Pontificia Universidade Católica 
do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro - Brazil, in 1998. His research interests include visualization, visual analytics, 
geometric computing, and data science. Nonato is a full professor at the Institute of Mathematical and Computer 
Sciences - University of São Paulo, São Carlos, Brazil, and he is currently a visiting professor at the Center for 
Data Science - New York University, New York, USA. From 2008 to 2010 Nonato was a visiting scholar at the Scientific 
Computing and Imaging Institute - University of Utah, Salt Lake City, USA. Besides having served in several program 
committees, including IEEE SciVis, IEEE InfoVis, and EuroVis, he was associate editor of Computer Graphics Forum from 
April 2011 to March 2014. Nonato is currently the co-editor of the SBMAC SpringerBriefs in Applied Mathematics and 
Computational Sciences. He was also the president of the Special Committee on Computer Graphics and Image Processing 
of the Brazilian Computer Society from October 2011 to September 2013. Nonato has advised 9 PhD, 14 MS students, 
mentored 5 post-doctoral associates and he has published over 120 journal and conference papers, some of which warded 
as "Best Paper" and "Honorable Mention" in important conferences such as IEEE InfoVis, PacificVis, Sibgrapi, among others.
