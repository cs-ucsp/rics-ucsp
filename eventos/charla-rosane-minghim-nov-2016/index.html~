<h4><strong>Charla: </strong>Visualization with mining in the context of Data Science</h4>

<strong>Expositor: </strong> 
Rosane Minghim, PhD - University of Sao Paulo (USP, Brazil)

<strong>Resumen:</strong>  
Visual Analytics is a research field of great interest that has progressed considerably in the last years. It relies 
heavily in both mining and visualization strategies and is an important component of the data science discipline. In 
this seminar, we intend to stimulate the discussion on the ways that mining tasks and tools can benefit from 
visualization techniques, and to illustrate how mining strategies can enhance visualizations.

Coming from the viewpoint of visualization research, a few techniques will be mentioned (such as dimension reduction, 
multidimensional projections, tree-based visualizations), and we will present some of our previous work on developing 
and employing these techniques to generate visualizations and to support mining tasks.  We hope to finish the 
seminar with a discussion on ways that visualization can move forward as a supporting tool for data mining of 
increasingly complex, and on ways to continue research on integration between these two fields.
